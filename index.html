    <h1>Max Tippetts</h1>
    <p>Hello. I am a Computer Science Major. I have moved around a lot. I moved here from Orem, Utah. 
        In my free time I play video games, mainly Pok√©mon and other turn based games but I'm trying to branch out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am 19 years old and have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life.
         I'm not married. I love the church and can't pick a favorite scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm currently going for a BS. I just signed up for this class because it looked fun.
